These are very basic Tableau projects where I've created the basics of 2 sheet or a dashboard which has visualized the followings:
1. Smallest File size by minimum file extension
2. Years and Quarters by minimum of '#'
3. Average 12 month percentage per region name as well as per index.
4. Sum of sales volume per region and yera wise.
5. Average of average sales per region.

I'm also attaching the link of these assignments for other references:
